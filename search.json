With the magic of {targets}, it will only process remote data that has changed since the last time the pipeline ran. The final outputs (maps, results table, and reporting status) are stored remotely in an S3 bucket (though in this example, outputs are stored locally).\nThe website project runs every Y minutes and uses {targets} to pull the latest data from the S3 bucket (or here, local data storage for the ETL pipeline). It then re-builds and deploys the Quarto website (this website!) if needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of the two pipelines"
